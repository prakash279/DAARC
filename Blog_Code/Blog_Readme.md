# I will guide you on how to run this blog code

# Prerequisites:
1. IDE: Any code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, WebStorm) is fine.
2. Terminal: Access to a terminal emulator for running commands.
3. Node.js: Download and install the latest LTS version. This includes npm.
4. MongoDB: Install MongoDB Community Edition. You can choose the official installer or a package manager like Docker.

# Set Up Backend:
1. Create a project directory: Make a directory for your project and open it in your IDE.
2. Initialize Node.js Project: Run npm init -y to create a package.json file.
3. Install Express.js: Run npm install express to install Express.
4. Create server file: Create a file like server.js and write basic Express server code.
5. Start MongoDB: Start your MongoDB instance or container.
6. Connect to MongoDB: In your server file, use Mongoose (e.g., npm install mongoose) to connect to your MongoDB database and define models.
7. Develop API endpoints: Add code to your server file for API endpoints (e.g., CRUD operations) for your data.

# Set Up Frontend:
1. Create React App: Navigate to your project directory and run npx create-react-app client to create a React app inside a client subdirectory.
2. Start React App: Navigate to the client directory and run npm start to start the React development server.
3. Develop React components: Create components for your website interface and logic.
4. Fetch data from API: Use tools like Axios (e.g., npm install axios) to make API calls to your Express server and fetch data.
5. Render data: Update your React components to display the data fetched from the API.

# Connect Backend and Frontend:
1. Proxy API requests: In your package.json file in the client directory, configure a proxy to redirect API requests to your Express server (e.g., proxy": "http://localhost:3000").
2. Run both servers: Keep both your Express server (e.g., using node server.js) and React development server running concurrently.

# Test and Debug:
1. Access your website in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000 (default React dev server port).
2. Test your functionalities and verify data flow between frontend and backend.
3. Use your IDE's debugging tools to troubleshoot any issues.
