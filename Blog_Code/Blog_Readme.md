# I will guide you on how to run this blog code

#1. Prerequisites:
-> IDE: Any code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, WebStorm) is fine.
-> Terminal: Access to a terminal emulator for running commands.
-> Node.js: Download and install the latest LTS version. This includes npm.
-> MongoDB: Install MongoDB Community Edition. You can choose the official installer or a package manager like Docker.

#2. Set Up Backend:
-> Create a project directory: Make a directory for your project and open it in your IDE.
-> Initialize Node.js Project: Run npm init -y to create a package.json file.
-> Install Express.js: Run npm install express to install Express.
-> Create server file: Create a file like server.js and write basic Express server code.
-> Start MongoDB: Start your MongoDB instance or container.
-> Connect to MongoDB: In your server file, use Mongoose (e.g., npm install mongoose) to connect to your MongoDB database and define models.
-> Develop API endpoints: Add code to your server file for API endpoints (e.g., CRUD operations) for your data.

#3. Set Up Frontend:
-> Create React App: Navigate to your project directory and run npx create-react-app client to create a React app inside a client subdirectory.
-> Start React App: Navigate to the client directory and run npm start to start the React development server.
-> Develop React components: Create components for your website interface and logic.
-> Fetch data from API: Use tools like Axios (e.g., npm install axios) to make API calls to your Express server and fetch data.
-> Render data: Update your React components to display the data fetched from the API.

#4. Connect Backend and Frontend:
-> Proxy API requests: In your package.json file in the client directory, configure a proxy to redirect API requests to your Express server (e.g., proxy": "http://localhost:3000").
-> Run both servers: Keep both your Express server (e.g., using node server.js) and React development server running concurrently.

#5. Test and Debug:
-> Access your website in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000 (default React dev server port).
-> Test your functionalities and verify data flow between frontend and backend.
-> Use your IDE's debugging tools to troubleshoot any issues.
